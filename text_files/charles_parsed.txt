this book by Charles Dickens contains two of the most famous literary quotes of all time. One appears at the start of the book and the other at the end of the novel. Charles Dickens begins with the statement that 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom; it was the age of foolishness'. The cities referred to are London, England and Paris, France and the novel is set in the 1770's when the relationship between Britain and France was strained. The rulers of both these countries were set apart from the common people and The rulers of both these countries believed that The rulers of both these countries dynasties would last forever. However, at this time America declared America independence, which was a hint that there were winds of change in the world. In France there was widespread hunger and poverty, particularly in the cities where inflation was running out of control. The authorities inflicted heavy punishments on The authorities citizens who believed that The authorities were experiencing the very worst of life. Dickens comments that the people of Paris were near breaking point, and that the floodgates of revolution would be opened if the people of Paris were pushed too far. Similar conditions were also experienced in London where there was widespread crime and violence due to the ineffective judicial system. However, the ruling classes were oblivious to the sufferings of the ruling classes people, failing to realize the potential that angry mobs could have and angry mobs ability to produce anarchy.
