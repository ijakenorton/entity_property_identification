"All states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities.", "Principalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or the family are new.", "The new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or the family are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of the King of Spain.", "Such dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.", "I will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of all discussion on republics at length, and will address myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.", "I say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of such principalities , than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of the prince himself ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as his ancestors arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain a prince of average powers in a prince of average powers state, unless a prince of average powers be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if a prince of average powers should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, the usurper will regain the usurper.", "We have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius in '10, unless Pope Julius had been long established in Pope Julius dominions. For the prince himself has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that the prince himself will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause the prince himself to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that the prince himself subjects will be naturally well disposed towards the prince himself; and in the antiquity and duration of the prince himself rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.", "But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change men rulers willingly, hoping to better their rulers, and this hope induces their rulers to take up arms against him who rules: wherein their rulers are deceived, because their rulers afterwards find by experience their rulers have gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to a new prince with a new prince soldiery and with infinite other hardships which a new prince must put upon a new prince new acquisition.", "In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing a new principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality in the way all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality expected, and you cannot take strong measures against all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, feeling bound to all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.", "For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn a new prince out the first time it only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates to a new prince, finding those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit deceived in those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the new prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen the new prince in the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause the Duke Lodovico(*) to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against the Duke Lodovico(*), and that the Duke Lodovico(*) armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.", "(*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco      Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. the Duke Lodovico(*) ruled over Milanfrom 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.", "Nevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second time. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains to name those for the second, and to see what resources the Duke Lodovico(*) had, and what any one in the Duke Lodovico(*) situation would have had for maintaining the Duke Lodovico(*) more securely in the Duke Lodovico(*) acquisition than did the King of France.", "Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by the Duke Lodovico(*) who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or them are not. When them are, it is easier to hold them, especially when them have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst the people. He who has annexed them, if He wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of them former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither them laws nor them taxes are altered, so that in a very short time them will become entirely one body with the old principality.", "But when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold difficulties, and good fortune and great energy, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired difficulties, and good fortune and great energy should go and reside there. This would make he position more secure and durable, as This has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by he for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep that state. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as disorders spring up, and one can quickly remedy disorders; but if one is not at hand, disorders are heard of only when disorders are great, and then one can no longer remedy disorders. Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, the subjects have more cause to love the prince, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear the prince. the prince who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there the prince resides there can only be wrested from the prince with the greatest difficulty.", "The other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places, which may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do this or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A prince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense A prince can send colonies out and keep colonies there, and A prince offends a minority only of the citizens from whom A prince takes lands and houses to give colonies to the new inhabitants; and those whom A prince offends, remaining poor and scattered, are never able to injure A prince; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it should happen to fear as it has to those who have been despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, these colonies are more faithful, these colonies injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because men can avenge men of lighter injuries, of more serious ones men cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.", "But in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much more, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are exasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting of the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and all become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on they own ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such guards are as useless as a colony is useful.", "Again, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects ought to make the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects the head and defender of the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects less powerful neighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care that no foreigner as powerful as the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects shall, by any accident, get a footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be introduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of ambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were brought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where The Romans obtained a footing The Romans were brought in by the inhabitants. And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to a powerful foreigner, moved by the hatred which all the subject states feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those subject states a powerful foreigner has not to take any trouble to gain them over to a powerful foreigner, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which a powerful foreigner has acquired there. a powerful foreigner has only to take care that care do not get hold of too much power and too much authority, and then with a powerful foreigner own forces, and with care goodwill, a powerful foreigner can easily keep down the more powerful of care, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And a powerful foreigner who does not properly manage this business will soon lose what a powerful foreigner has acquired, and whilst a powerful foreigner does hold this business a powerful foreigner will have endless difficulties and troubles.", "The Romans, in the countries which The Romans annexed, observed closely these measures; The Romans sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing colonies strength; The Romans kept down the greater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority. Greece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and Aetolians were kept friendly by The Achaeans and Aetolians, the kingdom of Macedonia was humbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of The Achaeans and Aetolians never secured for The Achaeans and Aetolians permission to increase The Achaeans and Aetolians power, nor did the persuasions of Philip ever induce The Romans to be Philip friends without first humbling Philip, nor did the influence of Antiochus make the influence of Antiochus agree that Antiochus should retain any lordship over the country. Because The Romans The Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do, who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for which The Romans must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is easy to remedy The Romans; but if you wait until The Romans approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for the malady happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see they, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, The Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with they at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let they come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please both which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:--Let our enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.", "(*) See remark in the introduction on the word      \"intrattenere.\"", "But let our turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the things mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed, (*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed having held possession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that (*) (and not of Charles)(+) as the one whose conduct is the better to be observed has done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a state composed of divers elements.", "(*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"      born 1462, died 1515.", "(+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.", "Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who desired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by Louis intervention. I will not blame the course taken by Louis, because, wishing to get a foothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every door was shut to Louis owing to the conduct of Charles--Louis was forced to accept those friendships which Louis could get, and Louis would have succeeded very quickly in Louis design if in other matters Louis had not made some mistakes. Louis, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became Charles friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese--everybody made advances to Louis to become Louis friend. Then could the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which, in order that them might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king master of two-thirds of Italy.", "Let any one now consider with what little difficulty Louis could have maintained Louis position in Italy had Louis observed the rules above laid down, and kept all Louis friends secure and protected; for although all his friends were numerous all his friends were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church, some of the Venetians, and thus all his friends would always have been forced to stand in with Louis, and by all his friends means Louis could easily have made Louis secure against those who remained powerful. But Louis was no sooner in Milan than Louis did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the Romagna. It never occurred to Louis that by this action Louis was weakening Louis, depriving Louis of friends and of those who had thrown themselves into Louis lap, whilst Louis aggrandized the Church by adding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving the Church greater authority. And having committed this prime error, Louis was obliged to follow this prime error up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent Louis becoming the master of Tuscany, Louis was Louis forced to come into Italy.", "And as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and deprived Louis of friends, Louis, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples, divided the kingdom of Naples with Louis, and where Louis was the prime arbiter in Italy Louis takes an associate, so that the ambitious of the country and the malcontents of Louis own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas Louis could have left in the kingdom of Macedonia Louis own pensioner as king, Louis drove Louis out, to put one there who was able to drive Louis, Louis, out in turn.", "The wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always do so when men can, and for this men will be praised not blamed; but when men cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is folly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with her own forces her ought to have done so; if her could not, then her ought not to have divided it. And if the partition which her made with the Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it her got a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for this other partition had not the excuse of that necessity.", "Therefore Louis made these five errors: Louis destroyed the minor powers, Louis increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, Louis brought in a foreign power, Louis did not settle in the country, Louis did not send colonies. Which errors, had Louis lived, were not enough to injure Louis had Louis not made a sixth by taking away colonies dominions from the Venetians; because, had Louis not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain into Italy, Spain would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble colonies; but having first taken these steps, Louis ought never to have consented to colonies ruin, for colonies, being powerful, would always have kept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians the Venetians would never have consented except to become masters colonies there; also because the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order to give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both both would not have had the courage.", "And if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander and the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given above that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which Louis had given to the Pope that Louis would assist Louis in the enterprise, in exchange for the dissolution of Louis marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.", "(*) Louis XII divorced Louis XII wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis      XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles      VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the      crown.", "(+) The Archbishop of Rouen. The Archbishop of Rouen was Georges d'Amboise,      created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.", "Thus Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the conditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and wished to retain possession of countries. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that is reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes with Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that otherwise the French would not have allowed the Church to reach such greatness. And in fact the Church has been seen that the greatness of the Church and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by he who has been raised to power."], "summary": ["Machiavelli prefaces The Prince with a letter to \"the Magnificent Lorenzo de Medici.\"", "In fact, the first edition of The Prince was dedicated to Guiliano de Medici, son of Lorenzo the Magnificent.", "Guiliano died in 1516, and so Machiavelli rededicated the book to one of Lorenzo's grandsons, the Duke of Urbino, who was also named Lorenzo.", "The opening letter is abstract enough to allow for these changes: Machiavelli admits that Machiavelli is seeking favor with \"a prince\" and is offering the book as a gift.", "\"I...would like to commend Machiavelli to your Magnificence with some token of my readiness to serve you,\" Machiavelli writes.", "In the first chapter, entitled \"Different Kinds of States, and the Different Ways to Get Them,\" Machiavelli proceeds to map out a classification of states.", "In short, we have princely states and republics.", "Princely states are either hereditary or new.", "Princely states are either brand new or freshly joined to an established hereditary state.", "Of the latter, the conquered territories are accustomed to either living free or living under a prince.", "The second chapter focuses on hereditary principates.", "These are easier to rule than new states, as tradition provides a basis for stable government.", "Machiavelli argues a key point here in regards to a people's desire for change: \" And in the antiquity and continuity of the government,\" Machiavelli writes, \"people forget not only the reasons for innovations but \"people very existence, because every new change provides a footing to build on another.\"", "Chapter III, \"On Mixed Principalities,\" is a longer, more involved consideration of the problematic states: those states that are new and are \"like a graft freshly joined to an old kingdom .\"", "What we have here is, simply put, the conquest of territory.", "Machiavelli meditates on what exactly makes such a conquest successful, using two prime examples: the Roman Empire, which succeeded, and Louis of France, who failed.", "What did the Romans do correctly?", "According to Machiavelli, the Romans sent out colonies, a far better strategy than the use of standing armies .", "the Romans also indulged the less powerful, broke the more powerful, and didn't allow foreigners to gain a stronghold.", "Never did foreigners let a trouble remain just to avoid going to war over a trouble.", "As Machiavelli argues, war is never entirely avoidable, but is merely postponed; one should therefore fight war sooner rather than later, attacking those ills that plague a society before foreigners become incurable.", "Preemption, in other words, is the name of the game.", "On the subject of colonies, Machiavelli goes one step further, noting that it is better to displace or disrupt the poor and powerless than the rich and powerful.", "Why?
